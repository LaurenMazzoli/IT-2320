     <h1>Lauren Mazzoli</h1>

     <h2>Hi there! Welcome to my web page.</h2>

     <p> I grew up in a small town in Northwest Ohio called Ada. It is the home of 
         <a href="http://www.onu.edu">Ohio Northern University</a>, the Wilson NFL 
         football factory, and a ton of corn fields.</p>

     <p> After high school, I attended ONU and I received a Computer Science degree. 
         Later on, I earned an MBA degree from the University of Pittsburgh.
         I worked in the field of Information Systems for over 10 years. The work was always 
         changing and never boring! I worked for several well-known organizations such as:</a> 

     <ul id="menu" style="text-align:center;list-style-type:none;">
         <li>
	     <a href="http://www.ppg.com"> <img src="images/ppg_logo.jpe" alt="PPG logo" 
                     style = "width:150px; height:150px;">
             </a>
         </li>
         <li>
	     <a href="http://www.pitt.edu"> <img src="images/Pitt_Seal.png" alt="Pitt Seal" 
                     style="width:150px; height:154px">
	     </a>
         </li>
         <li>
	     <a href = "http://www.ge.com"> <img src="images/ge_logo.jpe" alt="GE meatball" 
                       style="width:150px;height:150px">
	     </a>	
         </li>
    </ul>

    <p>   After starting a family, I left the workplace and began a new chapter in life. We relocated 
          to Atlanta, Georgia where we lived for 11 years.
    </p>

    <p>   Now we are back in Ohio and in "the Land". The kids are older and I am updating my technical skills to prepare 
          to return to work!
    </p>

    <p>   Here are some of the other things I enjoy doing:

          <ul id="menu2" style="list-style-type:square; margin-left:100px;">
             <li>Learning about nutrition & whole foods</li>
             <li>Volunteering for school, church, and sports groups</li>
             <li>Watching my kids compete</li>
             <li>Cooking & baking</li>
             <li>Home rennovation projects</li>
          </ul>
