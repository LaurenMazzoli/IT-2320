<h1>Lauren Mazzoli</h1>

<h2>Hi there! Welcome to my personal web page.</h2>
<p>I was born outside of Boston, Massachusetts. My family relocated to Ada, Ohio shortly after I was born because my father was a college professor. Ada is the typical small midwestern town located in Northwest Ohio where "nothing ever happens". It is the home of 
<a href="http://www.onu.edu">Ohio Northern University</a>, the Wilson NFL football factory and a ton of corn fields.</p>
<p> After high school, I attended ONU like most of my siblings and received a BS in Computer Science. Later on, I earned an MBA degree from the University of Pittsburgh.
    I worked for over 10 years in the field of Information Systems developing applications. The work was always changing and never boring! I met some amazing people along the way and I worked for several well-known organizations 
    such as:</a>

	</a>	
     </li>
  </ul>
<p>After starting a family, I left the workplace and jumped into parenting with both feet! We relocated to hot and steamy 
Atlanta, Georgia where I learned so much about life, including why red ants are called fire ants, grass does not always
grow "up", what a prayer warrior is, and not to make ice tea from powder. ever.</p>

<p> While in the south, we also expanded our family and our 11 years there flew by! We moved back to Ohio in 2012
   with hearts full of friends, more stuff then could fit into a full sized semi-truck, a dog, and a seventh, fifth and first grader in tow.</p>
 
<p>After four busy years here, we have settled into "the Land". I am researching colleges for my oldest child and updating my technical skills to prepare to return to work!</p>
<p>Here are some of the other ways I have spent my time "off":
